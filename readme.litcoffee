# Bemmer

Class utility to turn your insanely long bem class names into something a
little more managable.

This is stupid simple, so don't over-complicate it!

## More documentation

This readme should cover most of the nuances and basics, but for more good
reading, check out the litcoffee sources:

  * source/bemmer.litcoffee
  * source/class.litcoffee
  * source/react/index.litcoffee

## Including in your project

### Raw Source

> $ cp ./bemmer.js /path/to/your/project/javascripts/

### Bower

> $ bower install bemmer

### Npm

> $ npm install bemmer-node

*Note:* Apparently `bemmer` was already taken on the npm registry, so we have
sided with the name `bemmer-node` until we either rename altogether or the
name becomes available.  We were unaware of this project previously, and
only came across it when we went to register it with npm.

# Philosophy

Bem classes are named using blocks, elements, modifiers.  When creating classes,
you can end up with a ton of classes for just one element in a block, which may
look like this:

> .my-block {
    display: 'inline';
    border: 1px black solid;
    background-color: red;
  }

> .my-block__my-element {
    font-size: 16pt;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: white;
  }

> .my-block--active {
    background-color: white;
  }

> .my-block__my-element--active {
    color: red;
  }

Obviously, the pain comes to implementing it in your HTML/javascripts:

```
<div class="my-block my-block--active">
<span class="my-block__my-element my-block__my-element--active">
Hello World!
</span>
</div>
```

In the Javascript world, creating elements with long class names becomes a
little more unbearable:

```
myDiv = document.createElement('div')
myDiv.className = 'my-block my-block--active'
mySpan = document.createElement('span')
mySpan.className = 'my-block__my-element my-block__my-element--active'
myDiv.appendChild(mySpan)
```

Bem names can get very complicated very quickly, too.  The above example deals
with only one modifier, but any class could be expected to have any number of
modifiers, and on top of that, you may have a block that has several elements
inside which means you will be typing your block name (that is almost certainly
longer than the string 'my-block') several times, and your element name at
least that many, too.

Bemmer intends to take a bit of that pain out, using the Don't Repeat Yourself
(DRY) principle.  Your bem-related code will become more explicit, making it
easier for other developers to get on board without a full understanding of
bem.


# Examples

These examples are written in coffeescript, but I have written them in a way
that they more closely resemble plain old javascript.  You can safely ignore
any arrows ('->'), which just denote functions.

## With Npm

Since you'll be running this from inside the repository, the requires would
have to be relative, which isn't what it would look like in production code.
Instead, it's in a no-op block just so you can see how it looks.

>  bemmer = require('bemmer-node') # Export the wrapper function
Bemmer = require('bemmer-node/bemmer-class') # Export the class

    Bemmer = require('./bemmer-class')

## Basic Usage

    console.log('%cBlue!', 'Basic Usage Example:')

    bem = new Bemmer({
      block: 'header',
      element: 'title',
      modifiers: {
        'shaded': true
      }
    })

    output = bem.classes()

Produces:

    console.log('Expected Output: ', "header__title header__title--shaded")
    console.log('Received Output: ', output)

## With React and Coffeescript

**Warning:** this module hasn't been tested yet, so it may not even work at all

This works similar to the classes mixin in the React Addons package.

    ReactBemmer = require('./react/react-bemmer')
    console.log('%cBlue!', 'Bemifier with React and Coffeescript')

    div = ReactBemmer.DOM.div

    MyComponent = ReactBemmer.createComponent('my-component', {
      render: ->
        classes = @bemmer.with({
          element: 'container'
          modifiers: {
            active: @props.active
          }
        })

        return div(
          {classNames: classes},
          @props.children
        )
    })

`ReactBemmer` will take care of setting the `displayName`, and instantiating
`@bemmer` on your class, which is accessible from any method.  Bemmer will
assume your component name is also your block.  If this is not the desired
behaviour, although I would highly suggest it means you are going against the
grain, you can override the block name in componentWillMount like this:

> @bemmer = new Bemmer({block: 'whatever'})

## Details

Taking inspiration from [bem.info](http://bem.info/), your bem objects will
look like:

    myFirstBemObject = {
      block: 'what-a-blocky-mark',
      element: 'the-fifth',
      modifiers: {
        'active': true
      }
    }

    console.log('What does a BEM Object look like?', myFirstBemObject)

### Important differences!!!

1. **Blocks don't receive modifiers** - I don't know of a use case where this
is required in CSS.  To work around this, make a root element in your block,
and modify that.
2. **mods renamed modifiers for elements** - Being explicit is better than
typing less!  It makes the code more readable, which means more people can
understand what it does with less effort.
3. **Blocks are inlined** - bem.info's method for allowing blocks to be modified
is to have both type and mods properties on the block, then nested in contents,
you just add elements with modifiers.  I think this is convoluted, and
unnecessary, as addressed in my first point.

### But I'm using some third party libs, and string concat'ing is gross!

Add some custom css classes as the first parameter:

    bem = new Bemmer({
      block: 'my-custom-button',
      modifiers: {
        'large': true
      },
      classNames: 'btn btn-primary'
    })
    bemClasses = bem.classes()

Should produce something like this:

> "btn btn-primary my-custom-button my-custom-button--large"

    console.log('CSS class name concatenation with 3rd party classes:', bemClasses)

## Run this in node/your browser!

To run this in your console with node:

`npm run readme`
